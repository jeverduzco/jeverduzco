Hi, I'm Jes√∫s! A Full Stack Developer (JS, TS), DevOps and Mexican Entrepreneur who loves Latin America.

## What motivates me? üßê

I believe that collaboration is the basis of progress, and since I'm a total Geek, my way of doing that is by collaborating in open source projects and creating Software as a Service that brings value to our region.

I love technology, so I've created an Open Source Software, Software as a Service and DevOps lab, where I entertain myself creating cool stuff focused on Latin America.

Yes... on my LinkedIn you can find live events, voice events, video posts and articles. If you really like technology, I wait for you on my Twitch channel @soy_jeshu, there I do Streams with a tech theme and if you miss them they stay on my YouTube @soy_jeshu.
