### Hi there 👋

😏 My name is Jesus, but my best friend calls me Jeshu and you will always see me learning something that I don't need, I'm addicted to learning.

😎 Although my specialty is Computer Security, I love Web Development and Entrepreneurship. I am CTO of my own Startup.

🤓 I love creating things with code and I strongly believe that, if technology doesn't improve people's lives, then there is no point in creating it.
