## Who am I 😏

Hi, I'm Jesús! A Full Stack Developer (JS, TS), DevOps and Mexican Entrepreneur who loves Latin America.

## What do I work with? 🤓

JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, Deno, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, Vue.js, Nuxt.js, Supabase, GitHub, Docker, Kubernetes, Stripe and other things. 

## What motivates me? 🧐

I believe that collaboration is the basis of progress, and since I'm a total Geek, my way of doing that is by collaborating in open source projects and creating Software as a Service that brings value to our region.

## What am I involved in?🤔

I love technology, so I have created a minimalist Open Source Software and Software as a Service lab, where I have fun creating cool stuff focused on Latin America.

## Do I make content? 🤩

Yes... on my LinkedIn you can find live events, voice events, video posts and articles. 

If you like to know new applications, I wait for you on my Twitch channel @soy_jeshu, there I do live discovering Open Source Software and SaaS, if you miss them they stay on my YouTube @soy_jeshu.
